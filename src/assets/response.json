You have to attempt two assesment - Vocational Personality Test and Aptitude Test. You will receive a 10+ page detailed report upon completion and information on 2 career options. 3) What will happen after I pay and register? Your login id / password are valid for 6 months\u2013 you can take the test anytime in that period. Once you finish taking the test, the report will be available in your login itself, which you can read or download at any point of time in future. 4) Is any preparation required to take the test? No, our tests do not require any prior preparation. The Personality test is based on generic questions on common life situations like \"Do you like to work alone or in a team\". The Aptitude test has questions on Math, Logic, English etc. 5) How Scientific is this test? The Personality test is not timed. The Aptitude test is timed hence you need to allot 1 hour. Career Guidance Tests are developed using a team of Psychologists, Psychometricians and subject matter experts. The Personality test you will take is based on a very well respected and globally validated test framework called the Holland's code. All tests are suitably modified and tested for Indian population. Based on these tests Career Guidance has recommended the career and education path for 40,000+ students. Out of which more than 75% have followed the recommended path till date. 6) Can I re-take the Test? No. The best results are calculated the first time you take the test. So re-taking the Test defeats the purpose. 7) On what parameters my test is measured on? Career Guidance helps students to make scientific decisions about their future education and careers based on their Vocational Personality and their Aptitude. Vocational Personality test is a 60 questions test which evaluates the student\u2019s personality on six dimensions - i.e REALISTIC, INVESTIGATIVE, ARTISTIC, SOCIAL, ENTERPRISING & CONVENTIONAL. This is also called the RIASEC system. Out of these six the test finds out what is the dominant i.e. top 2 or top 3 dimensions and then maps it to the right career and education path. This is a 60 question test and has simple yes/no type of questions. Aptitude is measured on 5 parameters, which are, Verbal Ability, Logical Reasoning, Numerical Ability, Mechanical Ability & Spatial Ability. This test is also a 60 questions test to be completed in 1 hour. 8) Will my child\u2019s personality and interest change in future? At Career Guidance we are measuring Personality and Aptitude in a very scientific and systematic way. This is not like asking the student about his or her interest or just observing and deciding. This is more in-depth than that. Due to this we understand what is the \u201cCore\u201d Vocational Personality and the \u201cReal\u201d Aptitudes of the student. This will not change over a period of time. For example, if a child has an \u201cInvestigative\u201d Personality, this means that the child is better suited for activities which require \u201cthinking\u201d and not activities which require \u201cdoing\u201d or \u201caction\u201d. This will not change over a period of time. Only observed behavior will change. Hence the decision arrived at by Career Guidance\u2019s systematic, in-depth and scientific methods will hold good for long term. The Tests used by Career Guidance are based on very sound and validated theories. These have been in existence for over 6 to 7 decades and have stood the test of time. ",

Before joining SpeedLabs, Sonakshi was really frustrated and worried about her studies. During her gap year I observed that every mentor at SpeedLabs was very much committed towards the learning process, which was phenomenal. Every time we were stuck, the personalized guidance of SpeedLabs helped us. It has been an amazing journey. Ms. Dhwani Shivaram (Student) I was not acquainted with the major subjects in the stream of commerce, these were new to me when I entered Class 11th. SpeedLabs helped me to understand all the concepts and gave me a gist of everything. The mentors have provided me with a great learning experience, they have been very kind. The tests and worksheets have helped me to a large extent. The online sessions are crafted to make us understand everything in a very easy manner. After this journey with SpeedLabs, I have performed really well in Class 11th, which would have not been possible without SpeedLabs.

Testimonials Mr. Anmol Gupta (Parent) Sonakshi was associated with SpeedLabs, she is currently pursuing her education from IIT. All the credit of her getting into IIT goes to SpeedLabs. Before joining SpeedLabs, Sonakshi was really frustrated and worried about her studies. During her gap year I observed that every mentor at SpeedLabs was very much committed towards the learning process, which was phenomenal. Every time we were stuck, the personalized guidance of SpeedLabs helped us. It has been an amazing journey. Ms. Dhwani Shivaram (Student) I was not acquainted with the major subjects in the stream of commerce, these were new to me when I entered Class 11th. SpeedLabs helped me to understand all the concepts and gave me a gist of everything. The mentors have provided me with a great learning experience, they have been very kind. The tests and worksheets have helped me to a large extent. The online sessions are crafted to make us understand everything in a very easy manner. After this journey with SpeedLabs, I have performed really well in Class 11th, which would have not been possible without SpeedLabs.

                    "overview": " About the Course Plethora Beginner course is designed for students of age group 9-11 and focuses on teaching the core principles and skills of computational thinking, promoting computer science and software engineering practices. The topics covered by Plethora span from basic and simple ones in the Beginner course (like Cause and effect, User operations, and Parallelism) to advanced ones in the Advanced course (like Recursion, Real-time, and Local storage, and variables). With Plethora and its intuitive and appealing environment of visual rules, students focus on the algorithmic aspects rather than the syntax of the language. Accordingly, students can progress rapidly and reach stages where they learn aspects such as cause and effect, chain reactions, serial and parallel behavior, principles of abstraction and generalization, repetitive and recursive thinking, and more. The variety of concepts and ideas is easily accessible to students without having to get into complex issues in the field of software engineering such as objects, classes, inheritance, etc. Features Unique approach promotes teaching the foundations of Computer Science Over 200 levels to play Approved by the Israeli Ministry of Education and aligned with the CS4ALL standards Multilingual Course Structure This is the list of topics, concepts, and skills that are taught with Plethora in this course: Cause and Effect (25 levels) Students learn the concepts and meaning of events, rules, triggers, and effects. They identify the connection between a cause and effect and learn how rules can express these connections. User Operations (25 levels) Students learn about the possibility of human intervention in the behaviour of a system and how user operations can impact the flow and the final results of complex systems behaviour. Parallelism I and II (45 levels) Students get to know the meaning of parallelism and simultaneous actions. Stop conditions (15 levels) Students learn the need for defining a stop condition in an algorithm. Sequentially (25 levels) Students understand the difference between two events occurring one after the other or at the same time. Objects and properties (30 levels) Students learn the concepts of objects that are characterized by properties and behaviour. Conditional flow (15 levels) Students learn arithmetic comparison operators and the basics of control flow structures. Multiplicity (20 levels) Students learn the concept of multiplicity and activating an identical action on multiple objects at the same time. Abstraction (25 levels) Students learn the concept of abstraction that allows them to refer to objects, not necessarily in their concrete form but also in abstract forms. Iterative thinking (Loops) (25 levels) Students get familiar with the notion of iterations and iterative thinking using the loop construct. About The Partner Active since 2017, Plethora is a joint venture between the Department of Computer Science at the Weizmann Institute of Science and CET, aimed at developing and practicing core, interdisciplinary skills of complex problem solving and computational thinking. More than 250,000 students already practiced Plethora. Plethora is approved by the Israeli Ministry of Education; it is located high in the list of recommended platforms for teaching Computer Science in Hour of Code and is formally acknowledged as aligned with Computer Standards and teaching standards of the international CS4All organization.

Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA) CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law\u2019s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. According to CalOPPA we agree to the following: 0.1. users can visit our site anonymously; 0.2. our Privacy Policy link includes the word \u201cPrivacy\u201d, and can easily be found on the home page of our website; 0.3. users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page; 0.4. users are able to change their personal information by emailing us at info@cerebry.co. Our Policy on \u201cDo Not Track\u201d Signals: We honor Do Not Track signals and do not track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track browser mechanism is in place. Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked. You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser. 12. Your Data Protection Rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) If you are a California resident, you are entitled to learn what data we collect about you, ask to delete your data and not to sell (share) it.

We don\u2019t sell or rent your personal information to any third parties for any purpose. We do not sell your personal information for monetary consideration.

You are the only owner of your Personal Data and can request disclosure or deletion at any time. If you submit a request to stop selling your personal information, we will stop making such transfers. Please note, if you ask us to delete or stop selling your data, it may impact your experience with us, and you may not be able to participate in certain programs or membership services which require the usage of your personal information to function. But in no circumstances, we will discriminate against you for exercising your rights. To exercise your California data protection rights described above, please send your request(s) by email: info@cerebry.co.

According to CalOPPA we agree to the following: 0.1. users can visit our site anonymously; 0.2. our Privacy Policy link includes the word \u201cPrivacy\u201d, and can easily be found on the home page of our website; 0.3. users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page; 0.4. users are able to change their personal information by emailing us at info@cerebry.co.

Please note, if you ask us to delete or stop selling your data, it may impact your experience with us, and you may not be able to participate in certain programs or membership services which require the usage of your personal information to function.

                    "overview": " About the Course Plethora Advanced course is designed for learners of age group 11-13 and focuses on teaching the core principles and skills of computational thinking, promoting computer science and software engineering practices. The topics covered by Plethora span from basic and simple ones in the Beginner course (like Cause and effect, User operations, and Parallelism) to advanced ones in the Advanced course (like Recursion, Real-time, and Local storage, and variables). With Plethora and its intuitive and appealing environment of visual rules, students focus on the algorithmic aspects rather than the syntax of the language. Accordingly, students can progress rapidly and reach stages where they learn aspects such as cause and effect, chain reactions, serial and parallel behavior, principles of abstraction and generalization, repetitive and recursive thinking, and more. The variety of concepts and ideas is easily accessible to students without having to get into complex issues in the field of software engineering such as objects, classes, inheritance, etc. Features Unique approach promotes teaching the foundations of Computer Science Over 200 levels to play Approved by the Israeli Ministry of Education and aligned with the CS4ALL standards Multilingual Course Structure This is the list of topics, concepts, and skills that are taught with Plethora in this course: Cause and Effect (25 levels) Students learn the concepts and meaning of events, rules, triggers, and effects. They identify the connection between a cause and effect and learn how rules can express these connections. User Operations (25 levels) Students learn about the possibility of human intervention in the behaviour of a system and how user operations can impact the flow and the final results of complex systems behaviour. Parallelism I and II (45 levels) Students get to know the meaning of parallelism and simultaneous actions. Stop conditions (15 levels) Students learn the need for defining a stop condition in an algorithm. Sequentially (25 levels) Students understand the difference between two events occurring one after the other or at the same time. Objects and properties (30 levels) Students learn the concepts of objects that are characterized by properties and behaviour. Conditional flow (15 levels) Students learn arithmetic comparison operators and the basics of control flow structures. Multiplicity (20 levels) Students learn the concept of multiplicity and activating an identical action on multiple objects at the same time. Abstraction (25 levels) Students learn the concept of abstraction that allows them to refer to objects, not necessarily in their concrete form but also in abstract forms. Iterative thinking (Loops) (25 levels) Students get familiar with the notion of iterations and iterative thinking using the loop construct. Recursive Thinking (25 levels) Students learn standard and mutual recursion. Compound Conditions Students see how conditional flow constructs can be expanded to refer to more than one condition and understand the different ways and meanings in which atomic conditions can be connected to a compound condition. About The Partner Active since 2017, Plethora is a joint venture between the Department of Computer Science at the Weizmann Institute of Science and CET, aimed at developing and practicing core, interdisciplinary skills of complex problem solving and computational thinking. More than 250,000 students already practiced Plethora. Plethora is approved by the Israeli Ministry of Education; it is located high in the list of recommended platforms for teaching Computer Science in Hour of Code and is formally acknowledged as aligned with Computer Standard and teaching standards of the international CS4All organization.

Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA) CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law\u2019s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. According to CalOPPA we agree to the following: 0.1. users can visit our site anonymously; 0.2. our Privacy Policy link includes the word \u201cPrivacy\u201d, and can easily be found on the home page of our website; 0.3. users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page; 0.4. users are able to change their personal information by emailing us at info@cerebry.co.

Do Not Track is a preference you can set in your web browser to inform websites that you do not want to be tracked. You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser. 12. Your Data Protection Rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) If you are a California resident, you are entitled to learn what data we collect about you, ask to delete your data and not to sell (share) it.

Please note, if you ask us to delete or stop selling your data, it may impact your experience with us, and you may not be able to participate in certain programs or membership services which require the usage of your personal information to function.
